# PRODIGY_ML_05

Prodigy Machine Learning Internship Task 5

Develop a model that can accurately recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content, enabling users to track their dietary intake and make informed food choices.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/food-101

## Data Extraction

- Import all the necessary libraries
- Download and Extract the content directly from the kaggle datasets

## Understand Data Structures and files

- Check the extracted dataset folder
- List all types of data available for food

## Visualisation of Data

- Get one image of every single type of food

## Splitting the Dataset

- Split the dataset into Training set and Test set
- Check the total number of images in Training set and Test set

## Create a subset of data with few classes(3) - train_mini and test_mini for experimenting

- Creating Train mini and Test mini
- Picking 3 food items and creating separate folders for the same

## Fine tune ResNet50 Pretrained model using Food 101 dataset

## Visualize the accuracy and loss plots

## Predicting classes for new images from internet using the best trained model
